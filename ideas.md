# Ideas
We have the following ideas:
- Traffic
- Something like youtube channel Primer, competition, predator-prey (book chapter 4.1/4.2)
- Society based
- Zombies
- mate van autonomie
- Something physics

# Physics based
- Rockets to planet (Amigos to the moon)
    - Optimization
    - One large stage vs several smaller stages
    - Easy to start with, many assumptions and slowly remove these for better simulation
    - 3.4 from the book

# Autonomy with cars on road
- Amount of accidents.
    - Attentiveness, Autonomy and crash chance.
    - As Autonomy increases, attentiveness decreases.
    - On highway

# fight or flight.
- 1 predetor, prey - 2 genen, 1 flights other fights.
- predetor 2 stats: speed, strength
- If strength > fight group: fight group dies.
- If no fight group. Predetor catches speed amount of` prey
    - If to easy we can expand by having the flight gene affect if get caught or not
