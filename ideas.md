# Ideas
We have the following ideas:
- Traffic
- Something like youtube channel Primer, competition, predator-prey (book chapter 4.1/4.2)
- Society based
- Zombies
- mate van autonomie
- Something physics

# Physics based
- Rockets to planet (Amigos to the moon)
    - Optimization
    - One large stage vs several smaller stages
    - Easy to start with, many assumptions and slowly remove these for better simulation
    - 3.4 from the book
- What is the optimal fuel configuration for a rocket?
- Tasks
- Add component that adds probability, different air densities, wind changes
- Compare to actual results
- Python scipy, integration, finite difference/element
- Publications?

- Meteorological conditions



# fight or flight.
- 1 predetor, prey - 2 genen, 1 flights other fights.
- predetor 2 stats: speed, strength
- If strength > fight group: fight group dies.
- If no fight group. Predetor catches speed amount of prey
    - If to easy we can expand by having the flight gene affect if get caught or not
- Agent-based modelling
- How will the distrubtion of the fight and flight genes impact the survival of a spieces.

# Autonomy with cars on road
- Amount of accidents.
    - Attentiveness, Autonomy and crash chance.
    - As Autonomy increases, attentiveness decreases.
    - On highway
- Agent-based modelling
- How does a the level of autonomy in a vehicle have an inpact on the amount of crashes.
