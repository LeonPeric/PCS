# Project computional science
Planes use a lot of fuel during a flight, so airline companies are constantly trying to minimize fuel usage on their planes, because this saves them money. This project tried to simulate fuel usage of the airplane Boeing 787-9. For this we focused on two variables: wind force and jetstream influences.
